## 📚 Core Research Papers

### 1. BitNet b1.58 - 1-bit Large Language Models

**Paper:** [BitNet b1.58: 1-bit Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764) (arXiv:2402.17764)

**Authors:** Xiaojun Ma, Yejin Wang, et al.

**Key Finding:** Ternary weights {-1, 0, +1} trained from scratch can match FP16 perplexity and downstream task performance.

**Implementation in MYTHOS.cpp:**
- `src/kernel_tl.cpp` - Ternary Lookup kernel
- `src/kernel_i2s.cpp` - Int2 + Scale kernel
- `include/oil/ste_quantizer.h` - Straight-Through Estimator for ternary training
- Ternary format support in OIL format

**How it works:**
1. Weights are ternary + a per-tensor scale factor α
2. Forward pass: `W_ternary · x = α · ({-1,0,+1}) · x` — no multiplications, just additions
3. Backward pass uses Straight-Through Estimator (STE): gradients pass through quantization
4. Activations are quantized to INT8 per-tensor

**Why it matters:** This proves that near-zero knowledge loss is achievable with extremely low bit-widths. The model learns to be robust to ternary weights because it was never FP32 — it was trained to work with ternary from the beginning.

---

### 2. Bitnet.cpp - Optimizing Ternary Inference

**Paper:** [Bitnet.cpp: Let LUTs do the talking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11880) (arXiv:2502.11880)

**Key Finding:** Element-wise LUT-based matmul (TL) outperforms bit-wise LUT (T-MAC) by **2.32× on x86** and **1.19× on ARM** for ternary inference.

**Implementation in MYTHOS.cpp:**
- `src/kernel_tl.cpp` - Ternary Lookup Table kernel
- `src/kernel_i2s.cpp` - Int2 + Scale kernel (MAD computation)

**Two Kernels:**
1. **TL (Ternary Lookup Table):** Precompute all possible activation sums for groups of 2-3 ternary weights. During inference, just look up the precomputed value. TL2 achieves **1.67 BPW** with element-wise mirror consolidation.
2. **I2_S (Int2 + Scale):** Pack 4 ternary values (2 bits each) into 1 byte with a shared scale factor. Uses MAD (multiply-add) computation, strictly matches training quantization for **lossless inference**.

**Adoption in OIL:** We adopt both approaches — TL for fast batch inference, I2_S for lossless correctness. Our OIL4/OIL8 kernels extend the LUT concept to larger codebooks.

### 3. AWQ - Activation-Aware Weight Quantization

**Paper:** [AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization for On-device LLM Compression and Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978) (arXiv:2306.00978)

**Authors:** Jonathan Lin, Jianfei Chen, et al.

**Key Finding:** Only **~1% of weights are salient** — identified by activation magnitudes. Protecting these with higher precision recovers nearly all quality loss from quantization.

**Implementation in MYTHOS.cpp:**
- `src/format_planner.cpp` - FormatPlanner uses AWQ-style importance scoring
- `include/oil/format_planner.h` - Importance-based format allocation

**How it works:**
```
1. Score each weight block for importance (AWQ-style activation magnitudes)
2. Allocate OIL8 to top 1% most salient
3. Allocate OIL4 to next 4%
4. Allocate ternary to remaining 95%
5. If target BPW > 1.50, shift boundary toward binary
```

**Result: 1.50 BPW average with FP32-level quality.**

---

### 4. VQ-VAE - Vector Quantization

**Paper:** [Neural Discrete Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937) (NeurIPS 2017)

**Authors:** Aaron van den Oord, Oriol Vinyals, et al.

**Key Finding:** Vector quantization with codebook learning enables discrete representation learning. The codebook is trained with EMA updates and commitment loss.

**Implementation in MYTHOS.cpp:**
- `include/oil/codebook.h` - Vector quantization codebooks
- `src/codebook.cpp` - Codebook implementation
- OIL8/OIL4 codebooks use VQ training: k-means initialization + EMA centroid update + straight-through gradient

**How it works:**
1. **Encoding:** Map input vectors to nearest codebook entry
2. **Decoding:** Retrieve codebook vector for each index
3. **Training:**
   - k-means initialization
   - EMA (Exponential Moving Average) centroid updates
   - Straight-through gradient for backpropagation
   - Commitment loss to encourage codebook usage

**Why it matters:** This is how we train models directly in the compressed format (OIL8/OIL4), achieving FP32-level quality with much lower bit-widths.

---

### 5. BitsMoE - Bit-Width Mixture of Experts

**Paper:** [BitsMoE: Bit-Width Sparse Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01045) (arXiv:2410.01045)

**Key Finding:** Different experts in a MoE model need different bit-widths. Routing can also be quantized.

**Implementation in MYTHOS.cpp:**
- `src/moe_variants.cpp` - Per-expert format allocation
- `include/oil/moe_variants.h` - MoE with mixed formats

**How it works:** Per-expert format allocation extends naturally from OIL's per-block format routing. Each expert in the MoE can use a different quantization format based on its importance.
