# Internal Design Documents

> **Design Decisions, Rationale, and Technical Details**

---

## 📚 Overview

This directory contains **internal design documents** that explain the technical decisions behind MYTHOS.cpp's architecture. These documents are intended for:

- **Contributors** who need to understand the "why" behind design choices
- **Maintainers** who need to understand the system deeply
- **Architects** who are designing similar systems

Unlike the API documentation (which explains *how* to use the system) or the module documentation (which explains *what* each component does), these documents explain **why** things are designed the way they are.

## 🎨 Design Principles

The following principles guide MYTHOS.cpp's design:

### 1. Zero Dependencies

**Principle:** MYTHOS.cpp should have no external dependencies.

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates version conflicts and dependency hell
- Reduces deployment complexity
- Enables air-gapped training
- Provides complete control over the codebase
- Makes the system more portable

**Trade-offs:**
- More code to maintain
- Must implement everything from scratch
- May be less optimized than specialized libraries

**Exceptions:**
- C++ standard library (required)
- CMake (build system, but users can use alternatives)
- DirectX 12 SDK (optional, for GPU support)

### 2. Single Format Truth

**Principle:** The `.oil` format should be the single source of truth for models.

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates format conversion overhead
- Ensures consistency across training and inference
- Simplifies the ecosystem
- Reduces complexity for users

**Trade-offs:**
- Must support all features in a single format
- Format must be extensible
- Conversion from other formats is required initially

### 3. Research-Driven Design

**Principle:** Every major design decision should be backed by research.

**Rationale:**
- Ensures we're using proven techniques
- Provides theoretical guarantees
- Avoids reinventing the wheel
- Makes the system more reliable

**Trade-offs:**
- Slower to adopt unproven techniques
- May miss out on cutting-edge innovations
- Requires significant literature review

### 4. Performance-First

**Principle:** Performance should be a primary consideration in all designs.

**Rationale:**
- AI workloads are computationally intensive
- Every optimization matters at scale
- Users expect fast performance
- Enables deployment on resource-constrained devices

**Trade-offs:**
- May increase code complexity
- May reduce readability
- May limit portability

### 5. Modularity

**Principle:** Components should be cleanly separated and loosely coupled.

**Rationale:**
- Easier to maintain
- Easier to test
- Easier to extend
- Easier for others to contribute
- Enables selective use of components

**Trade-offs:**
- May introduce some overhead
- May require more boilerplate
- May make some optimizations harder

## 🔍 Key Design Decisions

### Why C++20?

**Decision:** Use C++20 as the base standard.

**Rationale:**
- Modern C++ provides better abstractions
- C++20 has good compiler support
- Enables use of modern features (concepts, ranges, etc.)
- Better performance than C++17 and earlier
- Still widely supported

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **C++17:** More widely supported, but misses useful features
- **C++23:** More features, but less compiler support
- **C:** Simpler, but lacks OOP and templates
- **Rust:** Better safety, but steeper learning curve
- **Python:** Easier to use, but slower and has dependencies

### Why Not Use PyTorch/TensorFlow?

**Decision:** Build from scratch instead of using existing frameworks.

**Rationale:**
- **Zero dependencies:** PyTorch/TensorFlow have many dependencies
- **Control:** We can optimize for our specific use cases
- **Learning:** Building from scratch helps us understand deeply
- **Innovation:** Enables novel approaches not possible with existing frameworks
- **Format:** We can design the perfect format for our needs

**Trade-offs:**
- Significant development effort
- Must reimplement many features
- May have bugs that existing frameworks have already fixed
- Smaller community

### Why the OIL Format?

**Decision:** Create a custom binary format (OIL) instead of using existing formats.

**Rationale:**
- **Mixed formats:** Existing formats don't support per-block mixed quantization
- **Train-in-format:** Enables training directly in the compressed format
- **Codebooks:** Supports vector quantization with learned codebooks
- **Flexibility:** Can be extended for future needs
- **Efficiency:** Optimized for our specific use cases

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **GGUF:** Popular, but limited to uniform quantization
- **Safetensors:** Simple, but no quantization support
- **ONNX:** Standard, but complex and not optimized for LLMs
- **PyTorch:** Requires Python, multiple files

### Why AVX2 Instead of AVX-512?

**Decision:** Target AVX2 as the primary SIMD instruction set.

**Rationale:**
- **Wider support:** AVX2 is available on most modern CPUs
- **Good performance:** AVX2 provides significant speedups (4-8x for many operations)
- **Compatibility:** Works on both Intel and AMD CPUs
- **Future-proof:** AVX2 has been around since 2013

**Trade-offs:**
- AVX-512 provides better performance on supported CPUs
- Some operations could be faster with AVX-512
- May miss out on newer CPU features

**Future:** Add AVX-512 support as an optional optimization

### Why DirectX 12 for GPU?

**Decision:** Use DirectX 12 for GPU acceleration on Windows.

**Rationale:**
- **Windows focus:** DirectX is the native GPU API on Windows
- **Modern:** DirectX 12 provides better control and performance
- **Availability:** Available on all modern Windows versions
- **Explicit control:** Better for our use case than higher-level APIs

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **CUDA:** NVIDIA-only, but widely used in AI
- **Vulkan:** Cross-platform, but more complex
- **Metal:** macOS-only
- **OpenCL:** Cross-platform, but less performant
- **SYCL:** Cross-platform, but newer and less mature

**Future:** Add Vulkan support for cross-platform GPU acceleration

## 📊 Architecture Decisions

### Layered Architecture

**Decision:** Organize the codebase into clear layers.

**Rationale:**
- **Separation of concerns:** Each layer has a clear responsibility
- **Testability:** Layers can be tested independently
- **Extensibility:** New features can be added to appropriate layers
- **Maintainability:** Easier to understand and modify

**Layers:**
1. **Core:** Types, Tensor, Memory, Math
2. **Autograd:** Automatic differentiation
3. **Model:** Neural network components
4. **Quantization:** Format-specific kernels
5. **MoE:** Mixture of Experts
6. **GPU:** Hardware acceleration
7. **Training:** Trainer, Optimizer
8. **OIL Format:** Binary format I/O
9. **Tools:** CLI utilities

### Engine Separation

**Decision:** Separate inference and training into different engines.

**Rationale:**
- **Different requirements:** Inference needs speed, training needs flexibility
- **Different optimizations:** Can optimize each for its specific use case
- **Clear separation:** Easier to maintain and extend
- **Optional features:** Users can choose which engine to use

**Trade-offs:**
- Some code duplication between engines
- More complex build system

### Format Planner

**Decision:** Use an importance-based format planner for quantization.

**Rationale:**
- **AWQ research:** Proven to work well in practice
- **Flexibility:** Can adapt to different target BPWs
- **Automation:** Removes manual tuning burden from users
- **Extensible:** Can add new allocation strategies

**How it works:**
1. Analyze model with calibration data
2. Score each weight block for importance
3. Allocate formats to hit target BPW
4. Optimize for quality within constraints
