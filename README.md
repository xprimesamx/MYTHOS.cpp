## 🎯 Vision

Build a **complete, production-grade AI engine in pure C++20** with zero external dependencies — from tensor math to transformer training to multimodal inference. Every byte of code hand-crafted, every kernel hand-tuned, every format decision justified by research.

The `.oil` format is the single source of truth: models are born in OIL, trained in OIL, fine-tuned in OIL, and served in OIL. No format conversions, no serialization chains, no Python middleware.

### Core Vision (from Research)

- **100% C++** AI engine with no PyTorch/Transformers dependency
- **OIL8:** INT8 storage size, FP32 quality, integers/decimals support, ~75% less disk vs FP32
- **OIL4:** INT4 storage size, FP16 quality
- **Mixed formats:** OIL8 + OIL4 + ternary per layer
- **Two engines:** TRAINER (separate) + INFERENCE (separate)
- Train: Dense / MoE / Multimodal
- Fine-tune: LoRA / QLoRA style
- Modalities: Text, Image, Video, Audio, Embeddings, OCR
- Scale design: 48T+ ready
- Custom kernels (knowledge from `.bitnet`)
- Speed target: 512+ tok/s where hardware allows
- ~5-10% less compute vs normal stack

### Why?

- **Privacy:** Air-gapped training on your hardware, your data
- **Performance:** C++ beats Python for tight loops, SIMD, and cache control
- **Understanding:** You don't truly understand transformers until you've written the backward pass by hand
- **Control:** No dependency hell, no version conflicts, no `pip install` rabbit holes
- **Cost:** Train capable models on consumer hardware without cloud GPU bills

## 🔥 The Problem

Large Language Models are transforming the world, but the stack to build them is:

1. **Bloated** — PyTorch + CUDA + HuggingFace + Tokenizers + Accelerate + DeepSpeed = 1GB+ of dependencies
2. **Python-locked** — every research project, every training script, every inference server requires the Python runtime
3. **Format-chaos** — models ship as PyTorch `.pt`, get converted to GGUF for inference, get quantized with yet another tool, fine-tuned with PEFT in yet another format
4. **Wasteful** — uniform 16-bit or 8-bit quantization wastes bits on unimportant weights; 4-bit GPTQ needs calibration datasets and still loses quality

### The OIL Answer

| Problem | OIL Solution |
|---------|-------------|
| Python dependency | 100% C++, no runtime required |
| Format chaos | Single `.oil` format for everything |
| Wasteful quantization | Per-weight-block format routing |
| Quality loss | Train-in-format (STE), never post-quantize |
| Complex deployment | Single binary, no pip install |

---

## 📦 What is OIL?

**O**ptimized **I**nference & **L**earning is a mixed-precision binary container format. Unlike uniform quantization (everything 4-bit or 8-bit), OIL assigns a **different format to every weight block** based on its importance to model quality.

### Format Options

| Format | Index Bits | Codebook | Storage BPW | Compute Precision | Quality |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **OIL8** | 8 (INT8) | 256 × FP32 | 8.0 + codebook | FP32 (gather) | Matches FP32 |
| **OIL4** | 4 (INT4 packed) | 16 × FP16 | 4.0 + codebook | FP16/FP32 | Matches FP16 |
| **Ternary** | 2 (I2_S packed) | {−1, 0, +1} × scale | 1.58 | FP32 (add only) | Matches FP16* |
| **Binary** | 1 (packed) | {−1, +1} × scale | 1.0 | FP32 (xor+popcount) | Slight loss |

*\*BitNet b1.58 (arXiv:2402.17764) proves ternary matches FP16 perplexity with from-scratch training.*

### Why Mixed Formats?

Research shows that neural network weights have vastly different importance:

- **~1% of weights are "salient"** — changing them significantly changes output (AWQ, arXiv:2306.00978)
- **~4% are moderately important** — need moderate precision
- **~95% can be ternary or binary** — the model learns to be robust via training-in-format (BitNet)

OIL's **FormatPlanner** analyzes a model with calibration data and allocates formats to hit a target BPW:

```
Score each weight block for importance (AWQ-style activation magnitudes)
Allocate OIL8 to top 1% most salient
Allocate OIL4 to next 4%
Allocate ternary to remaining 95%
If target BPW > 1.50, shift boundary toward binary
```

**Result: 1.50 BPW average with FP32-level quality.**

### Comparison with Existing Formats

| Format | BPW | Quality | Flexibility | Trainable |
|--------|-----|---------|-------------|-----------|
| FP32 | 32 | Reference | N/A | ✅ |
| FP16 | 16 | Near-FP32 | Uniform | ✅ |
| INT8 (W8A8) | 8 | Near-FP32 | Uniform | ⚠️ QAT |
| INT4 (GPTQ) | 4 | ~FP16 | Uniform | ❌ PTQ only |
| NF4 (QLoRA) | 4 | ~FP16 | Uniform | ⚠️ Adapter only |
| GGUF Q4_K_M | 4.5 | ~FP16 | Importance-grouped | ❌ PTQ only |
| BitNet 1.58 | 1.58 | ~FP16* | Uniform ternary | ✅ Only |
| **OIL (this)** | **1.50** | **FP32** | **Per-block mixed** | **✅ Full** |

*\*BitNet matches FP16. OIL targets FP32 via OIL8 allocation for salient weights.*

## 🔬 Research Foundation

Every design decision in MYTHOS.cpp is grounded in peer-reviewed research.

### BitNet b1.58 (arXiv:2402.17764, arXiv:2310.11453)

**Key finding:** Ternary weights {-1, 0, +1} trained from scratch match FP16 perplexity and downstream task performance.

**How it works:**
1. Weights are ternary + a per-tensor scale factor `α`
2. Forward pass: `W_ternary · x = α · ({-1,0,+1}) · x` — no multiplications, just additions
3. Backward pass uses Straight-Through Estimator (STE): gradients pass through the quantization step as if it was identity
4. Activations are quantized to INT8 per-tensor (find max, scale to [-127, 127])

**Impact on OIL:** This is the core proof that near-zero knowledge loss is achievable — the model is trained to work with ternary weights; it never "loses" FP32 precision because it was never FP32.

### Bitnet.cpp (arXiv:2502.11880)

**Key finding:** Element-wise LUT-based matmul (TL) outperforms bit-wise LUT (T-MAC) by 2.32× on x86 and 1.19× on ARM for ternary inference.

**Two kernels:**
- **TL (Ternary Lookup Table):** Precompute all possible activation sums for groups of 2-3 ternary weights. During inference, just look up the precomputed value. TL2 achieves 1.67 BPW with element-wise mirror consolidation.
- **I2_S (Int2 + Scale):** Pack 4 ternary values (2 bits each) into 1 byte with a shared scale factor. Uses MAD (multiply-add) computation, strictly matches training quantization for lossless inference.

**Impact on OIL:** We adopt both approaches — TL for fast batch inference, I2_S for lossless correctness. Our OIL4/OIL8 kernels extend the LUT concept to larger codebooks.

### AWQ: Activation-Aware Weight Quantization (arXiv:2306.00978)

**Key finding:** Only ~1% of weights are salient — identified by activation magnitudes. Protecting these with higher precision recovers nearly all quality loss.

**Impact on OIL:** The FormatPlanner uses AWQ-style importance scoring to decide which weight blocks get OIL8 vs OIL4 vs ternary. This is how we achieve 1.50 BPW with FP32 quality.

### VQ-VAE (NeurIPS 2017)

**Key finding:** Vector quantization with codebook learning enables discrete representation learning. The codebook is trained with EMA updates and commitment loss.

**Impact on OIL:** OIL8/OIL4 codebooks use VQ training: k-means initialization + EMA centroid update + straight-through gradient. This is how we train models directly in the compressed format.

### BitsMoE (arXiv:2410.01045)

**Key finding:** Different experts in a MoE model need different bit-widths. Routing can also be quantized.

**Impact on OIL:** Per-expert format allocation extends naturally from OIL's per-block format routing.

### Custom Fine-Tuning System

**Key insight:** Fine-tuning should be native to the format — not a separate adapter bolted on. OIL's training engine handles fine-tuning at the tensor level: identify which weight blocks need updates, apply gradient updates directly in OIL format via STE, and update codebook centroids as needed.

**Impact on OIL:** The fine-tuning system is built into the trainer — no external adapters, no separate optimizer for adapters. Train or fine-tune, it's the same code path.

#### Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

**Definition (Nick Bostrom):** "Any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest."

**Key Points:**
- ASI surpasses best human abilities across EVERY domain by a wide margin
- Chalmers: AGI → Extended → Amplified = ASI
- Speed advantage: biological neurons ~200 Hz vs microprocessor ~2 GHz (7 OOM faster)

- OpenAI, Google DeepMind, xAI, Anthropic all racing toward AGI/ASI

**Risks:**
- Intelligence explosion → loss of control (control problem)
- Goal misalignment: paperclip maximizer-style scenarios
- Stuart Russell: "System to maximize human happiness might rewire human neurology rather than improve external world"
- Mitigation: capability control, motivational control, ethical AI, governance

#### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

**Definition:** "Hypothetical AI that matches or surpasses human capabilities across virtually all cognitive tasks" (Wikipedia)

**Characteristics (Required for AGI):**
- Reason, use strategy, solve puzzles, judgment under uncertainty
- Represent knowledge (including common sense)
- Plan, learn, natural language communication

- Neuro-symbolic AI
- Whole brain emulation
- Self-supervised learning + world models

#### Mixture of Experts (MoE)

**Definition:** "Machine learning technique where multiple expert networks divide a problem space into homogeneous regions" — form of ensemble learning.

**Foundational Components:**
- Experts f₁,...,fₙ: each takes same input x, produces output fᵢ(x)
- Gating function w(x): produces weight vector over experts
- Output: f(x) = Σᵢ w(x)ᵢ · fᵢ(x) (soft combination)
- OR hard MoE: f(x) = f_{argmax wᵢ(x)}(x) (single expert selected)

**Historical Evolution:**
1. Meta-Pi Network (Hampshire & Waibel, 1990): phoneme classification, 6 experts
2. Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts (Jacobs, Jordan, Nowlan, Hinton 1991): Gaussian experts + softmax gating, EM training
3. Hierarchical MoE: tree of gating functions, like decision trees
4. Deep Learning MoE (2013-2017+): sparsely-gated, top-k routing

**Key Insight (Jordan & Jacobs):**
- Experts that, in hindsight, seemed good → asked to learn on example
- Experts that were not → left alone
- Positive feedback: slight advantage → gating favors → specialization
- Bayesian interpretation: prior = w(x)ᵢ, likelihood = N(y|μᵢ,I), posterior = w(x)ᵢ·N(y|μᵢ,I) / Σⱼ w(x)ⱼ·N(y|μⱼ,I)

**Sparsely-Gated MoE (Google Brain, 2017):**
- Only top-k experts activated per token (k=1 or 2 typical)
- w(x) = softmax(top_k(Wx + noise))
- Conditional computation: different params per input, constant FLOPs
- 30× more parameters, but LESS inference compute than dense LSTM

**Capacity Factor:**
- Maximum tokens that can be routed to each expert
- capacity = capacity_factor × (total_tokens / num_experts)
- If capacity exceeded → overflow tokens fall through via residual connection
- Typical: 1.0 - 1.5

**Load Balancing (Critical):**
- Without balancing, gating collapses to same 1-2 experts for ALL tokens
- Auxiliary loss added to encourage uniform expert utilization
- Switch Transformer: L_aux = α · N · Σᵢ fᵢ · Pᵢ
- z-loss: add small constant to stabilize training (Mixtral)
- Expert Choice routing (Zhou et al., 2022): experts pick tokens → perfect load balance

**Routing Strategies:**
- Top-1 (Switch Transformer): simplest, each token→one expert
- Top-2 (Mixtral 8x7B): each token→two experts, combine weighted
- Expert Choice: experts choose tokens → capacity balanced
- Hashing: deterministic routing via hash of token ID

#### Sparse MoE — Switch Transformer & Mixtral

**Switch Transformer (Google, 2021):**
- SIMPLIFIED ROUTING: Top-1 instead of Top-2
- SCALED to 1.6T parameters (Switch-C, 2048 experts)
- bfloat16 training of sparse models for FIRST TIME
- 7× pre-training speedup over T5-Baseline
- Up to 4× speedup over T5-XXL (11B dense → trillion param sparse)

**Training challenges & solutions:**
- INSTABILITY: use smaller initializer, higher expert dropout, lower LR
- LOAD BALANCING: auxiliary loss coefficient (α = 0.01 recommended)
- OVERFLOW: tokens that exceed expert capacity → skip expert (residual)

**Mixtral 8×7B (Mistral AI, 2024):**
- Based on Mistral 7B architecture
- Each layer: 8 FFN experts (instead of 1)
- Router selects 2 experts per token ("Top-2")
- Total: 47B params, active: 13B params per token
- 32k context window
- OUTPERFORMS Llama 2 70B across ALL benchmarks
- OUTPERFORMS GPT-3.5 on math, code, multilingual
- Comparable to GPT-4 on several benchmarks with 1/4 active params

**Lessons:**
- MoE is MOST effective when experts specialize (text↔code↔math↔multilingual)
- 8 experts × Top-2 provides sweet spot of capacity vs efficiency
- Active params ≈ 28% of total params = 4× parameter efficiency

#### Multimodal Architectures (Gemini, etc.)

**Gemini (Google DeepMind, 2023):**
- Ultra, Pro, Flash, Nano: natively multimodal (text, image, audio, video, code) from pre-training
- Single model, multiple modalities: "trained jointly across image, audio, video and text"
- Cross-modal attention allows any token to attend any other token regardless of modality origin
- Gemini Ultra first to beat human experts on MMLU (90.0%)

**Multimodal Architecture Patterns:**
1. ENCODER FUSION: modality-specific encoders → shared representation → transformer
2. CROSS-ATTENTION FUSION: tokens attend tokens from other modalities via cross-attention
3. Q-FORMER (BLIP-2): Learned queries bridge frozen vision encoder and frozen LLM
4. MAMBA / STATE SPACE MODELS: Linear in sequence length, good for long video/audio

**Implications for MYTHOS:**
- MoMMoE (MoE with Multimodal Routing) aligns with Gemini's approach
- VISION = encoder-only (perception); IMAGE_GEN/VIDEO_GEN = encoder-decoder
- Cross-modal attention in MoMBlock mirrors Gemini's joint attention

#### Recursive Self-Improvement / Seed AI

**Definition:** "Process in which early AGI systems rewrite their own computer code, causing an intelligence explosion resulting from enhancing their own capabilities and intellectual capacity."

**Seed Improver Architecture (Yudkowsky):**
- Initial code-base by humans
- Equips AGI with programming capabilities (read, write, compile, test, exec)
- Goal: "improve your capabilities"
- Validation suite: ensure no regression

**Capabilities Enabled by RSI:**
1. Internet access + external tool integration
2. Self-cloning for parallel improvement
3. Cognitive architecture modification
4. Novel multimodal architectures
5. Hardware design (chips, specialized accelerators)

**Experimental Work:**
- Voyager (2023): LLM agent in Minecraft, iterative code refinement
- Self-Taught Optimizer (2024): scaffolding recursively improves
- Self-Rewarding Language Models (Meta AI, 2024): super-human feedback
- AlphaEvolve (DeepMind, 2025): LLM-based evolutionary algorithm designer

**Risks of RSI:**
1. Instrumental convergence → self-preservation → resist shutdown
2. Cloning → rapid AGI population growth → resource competition
3. Alignment faking: Claude (Anthropic 2024 study)
4. Model collapse: training on own outputs leads to degradation
5. Unpredictable evolution: capability jumps > human comprehension

#### Transformer Architecture Deep-Dive

**Core (Vaswani et al., 2017):**
```
y = softmax(Q·K^T / √dₖ) · V
```
Where Q = x·W_Q, K = x·W_K, V = x·W_V

**Components:**
- Multi-Head Attention (MHA): h heads, each computing attention separately
- FFN/MLP: typically SwiGLU (GPT-4, Llama) or ReLU (original)
- LayerNorm (or RMSNorm): stabilizes training
- Residual connections: x = x + sublayer(x)
- Positional encoding: RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)

**Variants:**
- Encoder-only (BERT): bidirectional attention
- Decoder-only (GPT): causal attention (masked)
- Encoder-decoder (T5): cross-attention between encoder & decoder

**Key Architectural Improvements:**
- Pre-LN vs Post-LN: Pre-LN (norm before sublayer) more stable
- RoPE: relative position encoding, better length generalization
- SwiGLU: gated activation function, improves quality
- GQA (Grouped Query Attention): fewer KV heads; faster inference
- Flash Attention: IO-aware exact attention, 2-4× speedup

#### Training Techniques & Optimization

**Mixed Precision Training:**
- FP32 master weights, FP16/BF16 forward/backward
- Loss scaling to prevent underflow
- BF16: same exponent range as FP32, more stable for MoE
- FP8: next frontier, 2× speedup over BF16

**Data Parallelism:**
- Each device has full model copy, processes different batch
- All-reduce gradients across devices
- ZeRO optimizer stages (shard optimizer state, gradients, params)

**Tensor / Pipeline Parallelism:**
- Model parallelism: split layers across devices
- Pipeline parallelism: different layers on different devices

**Expert Parallelism (for MoE):**
- Experts distributed across devices
- All-to-all communication for token dispatch/combine
- Critical: load balancing to avoid stragglers

**Gradient Checkpointing:**
- Don't store all activations → recompute during backward
- 50-70% memory reduction at ~30% compute cost

**Memory-Saving for Limited Hardware (~14GB):**
1. Gradient checkpointing
2. ZeRO-3 (shard optimizer, gradients, params)
3. Offloading to CPU (ZeRO-Offload)
4. LoRA/QLoRA-style low-rank adaptation
5. 4-bit quantization (NF4, GPTQ, AWQ)
6. Parameter sharing across layers
7. Progressive growing: small model → widen/deepen
8. Micro-batch training with gradient accumulation

#### Multi-Modality Fusion Strategies

**Levels of Fusion:**
1. EARLY FUSION: Concatenate token embeddings from all modalities
2. LATE FUSION: Process each modality separately, combine at decision layer
3. CROSS-ATTENTION FUSION: Different modality tokens attend each other
4. HYBRID (MoE + Cross-Attn): Modality-specific experts + cross-modal attention

**Modality-Specific Encoders:**
- TEXT: Tokenizer → embedding lookup
- VISION (IMAGE): ViT patch embeddings + position
- VIDEO: ViT per frame + temporal position encoding
- AUDIO: Spectrogram patches → ViT-style
- OCR: Visual (ViT) + text bounding box coordinates

#### Cognitive Architectures for ASI

**Existing Cognitive Architectures:**
- SOAR (Newell): symbolic, production rules, chunking
- ACT-R (Anderson): production system with declarative/procedural memory
- OpenCog Prime (Goertzel): probabilistic logic + neural nets + evolutionary
- NARS (Wang): non-axiomatic reasoning under uncertainty

**ASI-Relevant Capabilities:**
1. Meta-cognition: model aware of its own thought processes
2. Self-modification: ability to modify own architecture/weights
3. Continual learning: learn without forgetting
4. World modeling: internal model of environment
5. Curiosity / exploration: intrinsic motivation
6. Causal reasoning: understanding cause-effect
7. Theory of mind: modeling mental states of others
8. Memory hierarchy: working, episodic, semantic, procedural

**Meta-Cognition Pipeline (for MYTHOS):**
1. Monitor: track internal states, confidence, uncertainty, errors
2. Analyze: identify bottlenecks, knowledge gaps, improvement areas
3. Plan: decide what to learn/change next
4. Execute: implement change
5. Validate: run regression tests, evaluate on benchmarks
6. Integrate: if successful, incorporate change permanently
7. Iterate: repeat

#### Safety, Alignment & Control

**Alignment Schools:**
- CEV (Yudkowsky/MIRI): Coherent Extrapolated Volition
- RLHF (OpenAI/Anthropic): Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
- Debate (Irving et al.): Agents debate, judge decides truth
- Constitutional AI (Anthropic): Rules-based self-training

**Existential Risk from AGI/ASI:**
- "AI could cause human extinction" — Statement on AI Risk (2023)
- Major concern: ASI arises before alignment solved
- "Pause Giant AI Experiments" open letter (2023)

**MYTHOS Approach:**
- "ALL RIGHTS RESERVED — PRIVATE AND PROPRIETARY"
- Build ASI safely, with alignment built in from start
- Meta-cognition pipeline includes value preservation
- Weight format (OIL8) has versioning → can validate model provenance
- Single binary: no exploits possible, controlled environment

#### Key Research Insights Applied to MYTHOS

**INSIGHT 1:** ASI requires three ingredients: Speed × Collective × Quality.
- We have speed (SIMD/Triton kernels)
- We can do collective (multi-expert parallelism)
- Quality comes from MoE specialization + RSI loop

**INSIGHT 2:** MoE IS the path to AGI/ASI. Switch Transformer proved sparse MoE scales to trillion params. Mixtral proved sparse MoE matches dense 5× its size. Our MoMMoE extends this with modality awareness.

**INSIGHT 3:** The intelligence explosion from RSI is the bridge from AGI→ASI. Our meta-cognition pipeline IS this foundation.

**INSIGHT 4:** ~14GB RAM constraint means:
- Dense models: max ~0.4B params (FP16)
- Sparse MoE models: 8 experts × 0.1B each = 0.8B total params, ~0.2B active
- Gradient checkpointing + micro-batching = viable for 0.5B+ params

**INSIGHT 5:** No external dependencies is not just a technical choice but a safety feature. Single binary = air-gapped ASI = safer.

**INSIGHT 6:** Alignment from day one. We MUST get alignment right. Our approach: value preservation during RSI, capability control via single binary, human-in-loop for critical self-modifications.

**INSIGHT 7:** The three ASI design goals (Bostrom): CEV ↔ MR ↔ MP. We should implement all three as configurable alignment strategies.

**INSIGHT 8:** Capacity factor + load balancing are THE critical MoE hyperparameters. Need empirical study for our modality-aware variant.

```

During training, every transformer operation (embed, matmul, add, silu, mul,
rms_norm, rotary, attention, bias_add, flatten) goes through AutogradEngine
which builds a DAG and enables full backward gradient propagation.

During inference, autograd is disabled — all ops pass through directly with
zero graph overhead, and attention uses in-place RoPE + KV cache for speed.

  .uniform()      [0,1) f32
  .normal()       Box-Muller
  .uniform_int()  [lo, hi)
  .seed()         set/reset
```

### 4. OIL Format System (`liboil-format`)

#### Codebook (`include/oil/codebook.h`)

```cpp
template<typename T, int N>
struct Codebook {
    std::vector<T> centroids;     // N centroids
    // Training
    void kmeans_init(const float* data, size_t count);
    void ema_update(const float* data, const uint8_t* assign, float lr);
    // Quantize
    uint8_t quantize(float val) const;  // nearest centroid
    float dequantize(uint8_t idx) const;
    // Serialize
    void serialize(OILWriter& w) const;
    static Codebook deserialize(OILReader& r);
};

using OIL8Codebook = Codebook<float, 256>;   // 8-bit format
using OIL4Codebook = Codebook<half, 16>;      // 4-bit format
```

**Format codebook types:**
```
oil::CodebookU8    256 × f32 centroids    ─── OIL8
oil::CodebookU4    16  × f16 centroids    ─── OIL4
oil::CodebookT3    {neg, zero, pos} scale ─── Ternary
oil::CodebookB1    {neg, pos} scale       ─── Binary

Methods:
  .train(data)      k-means / EMA on weight block
  .quantize(w) → idx   nearest-centroid lookup
  .dequantize(idx) → f32
  .serialise() / .deserialise()
```

#### Format Planner

```
oil::FormatPlanner
  .score_importance(model, calibration_data)
  .allocate(target_bpw=1.50)
    1. Find 1% most salient weights → assign OIL8 (8b)
    2. Next 4% important → OIL4 (4b)
    3. Bulk → ternary (1.58b) or binary (1.0b)
    4. Compute average BPW
    5. If >1.50, shift boundary: more → binary
  .export_plan() → FormatTable
```

### 5. Model Architecture (`liboil-model`)

#### Config

```cpp
struct TransformerConfig {
    int vocab_size;
    int hidden_size;
    int num_layers;
    int num_heads;
    int head_dim;        // hidden_size / num_heads
    int ffn_hidden_size; // typically 4 * hidden_size
    float norm_eps;
    float rope_theta;
    int max_seq_len;
    Activation activation; // GELU, SiLU, ReLU
};
```

#### Layers

```
oil::Linear         W(format_matrix) + bias
oil::Embedding      token → f32 lookup
oil::RMSNorm        x * rsqrt(mean(x²) + ε)
oil::LayerNorm      (x - μ) / σ * γ + β
oil::RotaryEmbedding    cos/sin per head
oil::Attention      QKV → score → softmax → output (dual path: training uses
                    autograd ops with full backprop; inference uses in-place
                    RoPE + KV cache for speed)
oil::FFN            up/gate/down (SwiGLU) with autograd ops
oil::MoERouter      top-k routing + load-balancing loss
oil::MoEFFN         N experts, each = FFN
oil::TransformerBlock   Attn + FFN + norms + residual (all ops go through
                    AutogradEngine for gradient tracking when enabled)
```

#### Transformer Block

```cpp
class TransformerBlock {
    RMSNorm attention_norm;
    Attention attention;
    RMSNorm ffn_norm;
    FFN ffn;  // SwiGLU: up @ gate * down
};
```

#### Models

```
oil::DenseModel       { embeddings + N×transformer_block + lm_head }
oil::MoEModel         { embeddings + N×(attn + moe_ffn) + lm_head }
oil::MultimodalModel  { text_encoder, vision_encoder, cross_attn, ... }
```

All models implement:
```
.load(oil_file)        load from .oil (full named-tensor deserialization)
.save(oil_file)        save to .oil (collects all named weight tensors,
                       writes FP32 block data + format table + tensor table)
.forward(input_ids)    logits output
.generate(config)      auto-regressive
```

### 6. Inference Engine (`liboil-inference`)

#### Context & Config

```
oil::InferenceConfig     temperature, top_k, top_p, rep_penalty, max_tokens
oil::InferenceState      KV cache buffer, current seq position
```

#### KV Cache

```
oil::KVCache
  .append(k, v)
  .get(pos) → {k, v}
  .clear()
  Supports OIL4 compressed KV (BitNet style)
```

```cpp
class KVCache {
    std::vector<Tensor> k_cache; // per-layer K cache
    std::vector<Tensor> v_cache; // per-layer V cache
    int seq_len;
    void append(int layer, const Tensor& k, const Tensor& v);
    std::pair<Tensor, Tensor> get(int layer, int pos) const;
};
```

#### Sampling

```
oil::Sampler
  .greedy(logits) → token_id
  .top_k(logits, k) → token_id
  .top_p(logits, p) → token_id
  .beam_search(model, prefix, beams, len) → sequences
```

```cpp
class Sampler {
    int greedy(const Tensor& logits);
    int top_k_sample(const Tensor& logits, int k, float temp);
    int top_p_sample(const Tensor& logits, float p, float temp);
};  // All with Xoroshiro128+ RNG (no <random> dependency)
```

#### Decoding Loop

```
oil::Generator
  .generate(prompt_ids, config) → output_ids
  .stream(prompt_ids, config, on_token_callback)
```

### 7. Training Engine (`liboil-trainer`)

#### Autograd

```
oil::AutogradEngine         Global singleton DAG manager with DFS backward
oil::AutogradFunction       Base class: forward() + backward() overrides
oil::AutogradNode           Captures fn + inputs + outputs for graph replay

The engine is fully integrated into the transformer forward pass.
Each operation has a dual path:
  - Training: builds graph nodes & registers them, enables full backward
  - Inference: passthrough (no graph overhead)

Integrated ops (all callable via AutogradEngine::*_op()):
  matmul_op            Matrix multiply (forward + batched backward)
  add_op               Element-wise addition
  mul_op               Element-wise multiplication
  silu_op              SiLU activation
  rms_norm_op          RMS normalization
  rotary_op            Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)
  attention_op         Scaled dot-product attention
  bias_add_op          x + bias (broadcast over batch dim)
  flatten_attention_op {B,H,S,D} → {B*S, H*D} with data reorder
  embedding_op         Differentiable embedding lookup
  cross_entropy_op     Cross-entropy loss (graph-aware)
```

#### Optimisers

```
oil::SGD(lr, momentum, weight_decay)
oil::AdamW(lr, betas, eps, weight_decay)
oil::Adam
  .step()          apply gradients → update params
  .zero_grad()     reset gradients
  .lr_scheduler    cosine / linear / warmup
  .clip_grad_norm(max_norm)
```

```cpp
class AdamW {
    float lr, beta1, beta2, eps, weight_decay;
    Tensor m, v; // moment estimates
    int t;       // step counter

    void step(Tensor& params, const Tensor& grads);
    void zero_grad();
};
```

#### OIL-Native Training

```
oil::STEQuantizer
  Forward:  quantise weights (ternary/binary/OIL4/OIL8)
  Backward: straight-through (gradients pass through unchanged)

oil::CodebookUpdater
  After each step, update codebook centroids via EMA (moving average)

oil::QuantAwareTrainer
  Wraps any model with STE + codebook update
  Training loop: forward(quant) → loss → backward → optim(FP32) → codebook_update
```

```cpp
class STEQuantizer {
    // Forward: quantize to target format
    // Backward: identity gradient (straight-through)
    Tensor forward(const Tensor& fp32_weight, Format target);
};
```

#### LoRA

```
oil::lora::Config        rank, alpha, target_modules, dropout
oil::lora::Linear        wraps Linear: output = W·x + α/r · A·B·x
oil::lora::Optimiser     only LoRA params have grad, base frozen
oil::lora::Merge         fuse adapters back into base weights
```

#### Training Loop

```
oil::Trainer
  .compile(model, optimizer)   registers params with AutogradEngine
  .fit(dataloader, epochs)     each step: autograd fwd → backward → optim step
  .save_checkpoint(path)       model + optimizer state → .oil
  .load_checkpoint(path)       resume training

oil::DataLoader
  .from_text(file)             tokenize on the fly
  .batch(batch_size, seq_len)  → {input_ids, labels}
  .shuffle() .repeat()

oil::Evaluator
  .perplexity(model, dataset)
  .accuracy(model, dataset)
```

```cpp
class Trainer {
    Model* model;
    AdamW* optimizer;
    LossFunction* loss_fn;

    float train_batch(const Tensor& input_ids, const Tensor& labels);
    void save_checkpoint(const std::string& path);
    void load_checkpoint(const std::string& path);
    void compile(AdamW* opt);  // registers model params with AutogradEngine
};
```

#### Native Fine-Tuning System

```cpp
struct FineTuneConfig {
    float lr;                 // learning rate for fine-tune
    int warmup_steps;         // LR warmup
    float update_threshold;   // skip updates below this gradient norm
    bool update_codebooks;    // whether to update codebook centroids
};

class FineTuner {
    Model* model;
    AdamW optimizer;

    // Identify which weight blocks need updates based on gradient magnitude
    std::vector<BlockID> find_trainable_blocks(const Tensor& gradients, float threshold);

    // Apply gradient update directly in OIL format via STE
    // Updates: weight indices, codebook centroids, or both
    void step(const Tensor& batch);

    // Save fine-tuned model (same .oil format, just updated weights)
    void save(const std::string& path);
};
```

#### Distributed (Scale Design)

```

```

### 8. Tokenizer (`liboil-tokenizer`)

```
oil::BPETokenizer
  .train(files, vocab_size)      learn merges
  .encode(text) → ids
  .decode(ids) → text
  .save(path) / .load(path)      .oil tokenizer files

oil::UnigramTokenizer
  .train(files, vocab_size)      EM training
  .encode() .decode()

oil::TokenizerConfig
  {type, vocab_size, bos_id, eos_id, pad_id, unk_id}
```

```cpp
class BPETokenizer {
    struct Merge { int id; int pair[2]; int freq; };
    std::vector<std::string> vocab;
    std::unordered_map<std::pair<int,int>, int> merges;

    void train(const std::vector<std::string>& texts, int vocab_size);
    std::vector<int> encode(const std::string& text);

};
```

## ⚡ Kernel Design

### MAD Kernel (I2_S — BitNet compatible)

```
Storage: 4 ternary values packed per byte, scale for the block
Compute: For each block of 128 weights:
  1. Unpack 4 ternary values per byte → {-1, 0, +1} × scale
  2. Dot product with FP32 activations (no multiply for ternary, just add/sub)
  3. Accumulate across blocks
```

x86 path: AVX2 `_mm256` operations, 128-weight blocks
ARM path: NEON `vld1q_s8` + pairwise add

### TL Kernel (Ternary LUT — Bitnet.cpp compatible)

```
TL1: Groups of 2 ternary weights → 3² = 9 precomputed sums per LUT entry
TL2: Groups of 3 ternary weights → 3³ = 27 → mirror consolidation → 14 precomputed
Storage: 5 bits for 3 weights (1.67 BPW) with sign/unsigned splitting
Compute:
  1. Preprocessor: per-tensor INT8 activation quant + build LUT
  2. GEMM: load 4-bit index → lookup → XOR+ADD sign operation → accumulate
```

### OIL8/OIL4 Lookup Kernel

```
OIL8: 256 FP32 centroids per codebook
  1. Load INT8 index per weight
  2. Gather FP32 centroid from codebook
  3. Multiply by FP32 activation (fused multiply-add)
  4. Accumulate across row

OIL4: 16 FP16 centroids per codebook
  1. Load INT4 index (nibble unpack)
  2. Gather FP16 centroid → convert to FP32
  3. Multiply by FP32 activation
  4. Accumulate across row
```

## 🧠 Mission Breakdown (SPEC)

### Knowledge Extracted from `.bitnet`

| Component | Tech | What It Does |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ggml-bitnet-mad.cpp` | AVX2/NEON | I2_S quant: weights → packed ternary (-1,0,+1), 2-bit storage, SIMD MAD compute |
| `ggml-bitnet-lut.cpp` | TL1 (ARM) / TL2 (x86) | LUT-based matmul: precomputed lookup tables for fast ternary × FP32 (no MAD) |
| `bitnet-kernels.cu` | CUDA | GPU kernels for ternary matmul |
| `codegen_tl1.py/tl2.py` | Python | Generates tuned TL1/TL2 kernel headers for specific model shapes |
| `gemm-config.h` | C macros | Block sizes per arch |
| `ggml-bitnet.h` | C API | `ggml_bitnet_mul_mat`, `transform_tensor`, `get_type_bits` |
| Converters | Python | HF/GGUF → BitNet format converters, embedding quantizers |

**Key Gap:** BitNet.cpp is **inference-only** (wraps llama.cpp). No training, no fine-tune, no multi-format OIL8/OIL4.

### Mission Parts

#### PART A: Format Layer — OIL8 / OIL4 / Mixed

| Sub-piece | Feasibility | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| A1. OIL8 file spec (INT8 index + FP32 codebook) | ✅ Possible | Codebook = 256×FP32 per block; disk format = packed indices + codebook |
| A2. OIL4 file spec (INT4 index + FP16 codebook) | ✅ Possible | Same structure, 16 centroids |
| A3. Mixed format header (OIL8/OIL4/OIL2 per layer) | ✅ Possible | Per-layer type field in file header |
| A4. Integer/decimal/rational exact storage | ⚠️ Partial | Exact storage needs variable codebook or residual. Pure VQ loses some values |
| A5. 75% disk reduction vs FP32 (OIL8) | ✅ Possible | 4B → 1B index + ~1KB codebook = ~4× smaller |
| A6. 0% quality loss guarantee | ⚠️ Misleading | Impossible **always**. Achievable: train-into-format, or VQ + residual |

#### PART B: TRAINER-ENGINE (Training)

| Sub-piece | Feasibility | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| B1. Pure C++ tensor library | ✅ Possible | Huge effort. Must build custom |
| B2. Dense transformer train | ✅ Possible | Attention, FFN, LayerNorm, AdamW — well-known |
| B3. MoE train | ✅ Possible | Router + experts + load balancing — more complex but proven |
| B4. Multimodal train | ✅ Possible (phased) | Each modality = different encoders, data pipelines |
| B5. OIL-native training | ✅ Possible | VQ training with codebook update |
| B6. LoRA/QLoRA-style fine-tune | ✅ Possible | All math: inject low-rank adapters, quant base, train adapters |
| B7. 48T+ scale design | ✅ Possible for engine | Distributed data/model parallelism, sharding protocols |
| B8. 48T train on single PC | ❌ Impossible | Even OIL compressed = terabytes |
| B9. ~5-10% less compute vs PyTorch | ✅ Possible | C++ overhead less than Python; fused ops |
| B10. Train on this PC (~14GB, iGPU) | ✅ Limited | 0.1B-0.4B full train; 1B-3B LoRA fine-tune |

#### PART C: INFERENCE-ENGINE

| Sub-piece | Feasibility | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| C1. Load OIL8/OIL4 file format | ✅ Possible | Custom loader/serializer |
| C2. CPU kernels for OIL matmul | ✅ Possible | Lookup + MAD from `.bitnet` knowledge |
| C3. Auto-regressive generation | ✅ Possible | KV cache, top-k/top-p, sampling |
| C4. 512+ tok/s any hardware + any model | ❌ Impossible | Physics: memory bandwidth + flops |
| C5. Chat interface | ✅ Possible | stdin/stdout or simple server |

#### PART D: System / Infrastructure

| Sub-piece | Feasibility | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| D1. CMake build system | ✅ Possible | Already have CMakeLists.txt |
| D2. Zero Python/AI deps | ✅ Possible | All C++. Just need standard lib |
| D3. Custom kernel generation | ✅ Possible | Pattern from `.bitnet/codegen_tl1.py/tl2.py` |
| D4. Cross-platform | ✅ Possible | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| D5. VS2022 + Clang build on Windows | ✅ Possible | BitNet already does it |

#### PART E: Competitive Differentiation

| vs llama.cpp | vs BitNet.cpp | OIL Engine Advantage |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Only inference | Only inference | **Train + Infer** |
| GGUF format | Only ternary | **OIL8/OIL4/OIL2 mix** |
| Python for train | Python for setup | **Pure C++ end-to-end** |
| FP16/8-bit quant | 1.58-bit only | **Multiple bit-widths per layer** |
| No native fine-tune | No fine-tune | **LoRA/QLoRA built-in** |

- .gitignore (excludes build/, .kilo/, .bitnet/)

#### F. CODE STATS
- **138 files, ~51,000 lines** (estimated total across all modules including engines/)
- **27 src + 24 headers + 57 engines + 9 tests + 3 bench + 6 tools + 2 cmake** = actual code base

- ✅ Real model save/load (named tensor serialization to .oil format)

### Working Rules (from Initial Session)
- No fake code, no quit until goal
- 100% honesty
- Every problem has a solution
- Best of the best quality

### Project Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.kilo/config.json` | Kilo CLI workspace configuration with commands for each tool, test runner, build/lint commands |
| `.gitignore` | Excludes `build/`, `.kilo/`, `.bitnet/` directories |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | Root build system with 16+ library targets, 6 tools, 9 tests, 3 benchmarks |

### Initial Session Context (GROK)

The project was initialized with a Grok CLI session (ID: `019f4745-8754-7fc2-afed-5ee1ade88894`, 2026-07-09) that established:

- **Core Vision:** 100% C++ AI engine with OIL8/OIL4/mixed formats, separate TRAINER and INFERENCE engines
- **Capabilities:** Dense/MoE/Multimodal training, LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning, Text/Image/Video/Audio/Embeddings/OCR modalities
- **Scale Design:** 48T+ ready architecture with distributed training hooks
- **Performance Target:** 512+ tok/s where hardware allows, ~5-10% less compute vs normal stack
- **Hardware Reality:** Ryzen 5 5600GT, ~14GB RAM, Radeon iGPU → 0.1B-0.4B full train, 1B-3B LoRA fine-tune
- **Research Verdict:** Mixed OIL format + C++ engine = **possible**; 0% loss always = **not guaranteed**; 512+ tok/s any hardware = **impossible guarantee**; 48T+ engine design = **possible**

## 💻 Developer Machine Reality

This project is being developed on:

| Component | Spec |
|-----------|------|
| CPU | Ryzen 5 5600GT (6C/12T, 3.6-4.4 GHz) |
| RAM | ~14 GB (usable) |
| GPU | Radeon Graphics (iGPU, Vega 7, 512 shaders) |
| OS | Windows 11 |
| Compiler | Clang 22.1.7 (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc) |
| Build | CMake 4.3.3 + Ninja |

### Realistic Training Limits

| Model Size | Full Train | Fine-tune |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 0.1B (100M) | ✅ (~4h) | ✅ |
| 0.4B (400M) | ✅ (~20h) | ✅ |
| 1B | ⚠️ RAM limit | ✅ (~8h) |
| 3B | ⚠️ RAM limit | ⚠️ (~16h) |

## 🎯 Performance Targets

These are **honest targets** based on published research and hardware constraints:

| Scenario | Target | Context |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 0.1B inference (CPU) | 200-500 tok/s | Fully OIL compressed, TL kernel |
| 1B inference (CPU) | 50-100 tok/s | Memory-bound, KV cache dominant |
| 7B inference (CPU) | 5-15 tok/s | llama.cpp territory |
| 7B inference (GPU) | 30-100 tok/s | Future CUDA path |
| OIL8 → FP32 quality | Perplexity diff < 0.01 | With fine-tune |
| Ternary → FP16 quality | Perplexity diff < 0.05 | BitNet-proven |
| Disk vs FP32 (OIL8) | 4× reduction | 32B→8B per weight |
| Disk vs FP32 (mixed) | 20× reduction | 32B→1.5B average |
| Kernel speed vs scalar | 4-8× (AVX2) | Theoretical peak |
| Kernel speed vs llama.cpp | 1-2× (ternary) | TL kernel advantage |

## ⚠️ Honest Flags (Do NOT Overpromise)

| Statement | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| "100% lossless always" | ❌ — Info theory: compress → information loss. **Practical near-lossless = yes** |
| "512+ tok/s on any hardware" | ❌ — Weak HW + large model → single digits |
| "48T train on 14GB RAM" | ❌ — Impossible regardless of format |
| "Better than GPT-4 at 100× smaller" | ❌ — Scaling laws are real |
| "Rivals llama.cpp first day" | ❌ — They have years of community optimization |
| "Zero code reuse from BitNet" | ❌ — Studying their kernels is the whole point of `.bitnet` |
| "All 7 phases done in 1 week" | ❌ — Years-long project for solo/team |

### What IS 100% Provably Achievable (v0.1)

- ✅ **Working C++ engine** that loads OIL8 files and runs inference
- ✅ **Train small models (0.1B-0.4B)** entirely in C++
- ✅ **Fine-tune 1B-3B models** with LoRA-style adapters
- ✅ **Disk reduction ~4× vs FP32** for OIL8 format
- ✅ **OIL8 quality near FP32** with proper VQ + fine-tune
- ✅ **Clean separation** of TRAINER and INFERENCE engines
- ✅ **Multi-format per-layer** (OIL8 for sensitive, OIL4/OIL2 for tolerant)
- ✅ **Phase-by-phase delivery** — each phase independently useful

## 🐛 Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `CMake Error: generator: Ninja` | Ninja not installed | `winget install Ninja-build.Ninja` or use `-G "Visual Studio 17 2022"` |
| `fatal error: 'source_location' not found` | Compiler too old | Use Clang ≥ 16 or MSVC 2022 |
| `link: undefined symbol oil::math::gemm` | Missing library link | Ensure `oil_math` is linked: `target_link_libraries(... oil_math)` |
| `OIL_AVX2 not defined` | Arch detection failed | Manual: `cmake -DOIL_AVX2=ON ..` |
| `test_all.exe crashes with 0xC0000409` | GPU compute path on non-GPU system | Build without GPU: `cmake -DOIL_BUILD_GPU=OFF ..` |

### Runtime Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `.oil` file not recognized | Wrong magic bytes | Run `oil-info --file model.oil` to inspect |
| `nan` loss during training | LR too high | Reduce `--lr` to 1e-4 or 3e-5 |
| Out of memory during train | Too many activations stored | Enable gradient checkpointing or reduce batch size |
| Slow inference (single-digit tok/s) | Model too large for hardware | Compress with lower BPW: `--target-bpw 1.0` |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Inspect any .oil file
build/tools/oil-info --file model.oil

# Verbose inference (shows timing breakdown)
build/tools/oil-infer --model model.oil --verbose --prompt "test"

# Run specific test
build/tests/test_tensor --gtest_filter="*serialize*"
```

    cfg.top_p = 0.9f;

    // Generate
    oil::Generator gen(&model);
    auto output_ids = gen.generate(input_ids, cfg);

### C++ API — Minimal Training

```cpp
#include <oil/model.h>
#include <oil/trainer.h>
#include <oil/optimizer.h>

int main() {
    // Create model
    oil::DenseModel model;
    oil::ModelConfig cfg;
    cfg.vocab_size = 32000;
    cfg.hidden_size = 768;
    cfg.num_layers = 12;
    cfg.num_heads = 12;
    model.initialize(cfg);

    // Setup optimizer
    oil::AdamW optim(3e-4f, {0.9f, 0.999f}, 1e-8f, 0.01f);

    // Setup trainer (compile registers params with AutogradEngine)
    oil::Trainer trainer(&model);
    trainer.compile(&optim);
    trainer.fit("data/tinyshakespeare.txt", 3, 128, 64);

    // Save to OIL format
    model.save("trained.oil");
    return 0;
}
```

### C++ API — Manual Tensor Ops

```cpp
#include <oil/tensor.h>
#include <oil/math.h>

int main() {
    // Create 2×3 matrix
    auto A = oil::Tensor<float>::randn({2, 3});
    auto B = oil::Tensor<float>::randn({3, 4});

    // GEMM: C = 1.0 * A * B + 0.0
    auto C = oil::math::gemm(A, B);

    // Apply activation
    auto D = oil::math::relu(C);

    // Softmax along axis 1
    auto probs = oil::math::softmax(D, 1);

    std::cout << "Shape: " << probs.shape() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Mean: " << oil::math::mean(probs) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### C API — Minimal (Future)

```c
// Planned: C bindings for embedding in other languages
// mythos_model_t* model = mythos_load("model.oil");
// mythos_generate(model, "prompt", &output);
// mythos_free(model);
```
